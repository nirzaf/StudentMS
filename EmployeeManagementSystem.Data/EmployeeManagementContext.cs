    /// - If a local SQL Express instance is available(installed by default with Visual Studio 2010) then Code First has created the database on that instance
    /// - If SQL Express isn’t available then Code First will try and use LocalDb(installed by default with Visual Studio 2012)
    /// - The database is named after the fully qualified name of the derived context, in our case that is EmployeeManagementSystem.Data.EmployeeManagementContext
